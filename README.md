## Overview

**WP Manager Pro** replaces the need for multiple separate admin plugins by providing a single, fast, modern interface for managing every critical aspect of a WordPress site. It ships as a standard WordPress plugin — install it, activate it, and a full React-powered control panel appears under your WP Admin menu.

All operations happen through a secured REST API (`wp-manager-pro/v1`) that requires the `manage_options` capability on every route.

## What's New in v2.4.0 — Dev Tools

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔴 Bundled Redis drop-in | Installs its own `object-cache.php` — no third-party redis-cache plugin required; works with PhpRedis out of the box |
| 📊 Object Cache tab | Overview: status rows, connection details, live Redis stats (hit ratio, keys, memory, uptime, clients, ops/sec) + per-request WP cache stats; Diagnostics tab with full text dump |
| ⚡ Redis admin bar node | Green pulsing dot + Redis version badge in WP admin bar; sub-items: **Flush Cache** (AJAX with "Redis cache cleared" toast) and **Object Cache Settings** link |
| 🔧 Maintenance bar setting | "Show Toggle in Admin Bar" toggle in Access & Extras — hidden by default on fresh installs; custom `?wmp_preview=` slug for bypass URL |
| 🛠️ Bug fixes | Asset cache-busting via `filemtime()`, maintenance booleans stored as 0/1, page reloads after save so admin bar updates instantly |

## FAQ

### How do I open WP Manager Pro?
After activating the plugin, click **WP Manager** in the WordPress admin sidebar, or click the **Open** link in the Plugins list row next to WP Manager Pro.

### Who can access WP Manager Pro?
Only WordPress users with the `manage_options` capability (Administrators). Every REST API endpoint enforces this — lower-privileged users receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

### How do I put my site in maintenance mode?
Go to **Maintenance** in the sidebar. Use the **Content** tab to set your title and message, the **Appearance** tab to choose a gradient and icon, and the **Extras** tab to add a countdown timer. Click **Enable Maintenance** to go live, or **Save Settings** to persist your design without changing the active state. The maintenance page is removed automatically when you disable it or deactivate the plugin.

### How do I downgrade a plugin or theme to an older version?
In **Plugin Manager** or **Theme Manager**, click the clock/history icon (⏱) on any plugin or theme row. A dialog loads all available versions from WordPress.org. Click **Install** next to the version you want — the plugin/theme stays active after the switch.

### How do I hide the WordPress login page?
Go to **Security → Login** tab. Enter a secret slug (e.g. `my-secret-login`) and click **Enable Protection**. Your login page moves to `yoursite.com/my-secret-login`. Direct GET requests to `wp-login.php` are redirected to the homepage. Copy the new URL with the clipboard button before saving. To restore the default, click **Disable Protection**.

### How do I block brute-force login attacks?
Go to **Security → Login** tab. Enable the **Login Attempt Limiter** and set your desired max attempts, counting window (seconds), and lockout duration (seconds). When an IP exceeds the limit it is automatically blocked; you can view and unlock locked-out IPs in the **Lockout Log** section below.

### How do I block a specific IP or IP range?
Go to **Security → Hardening** tab. Enter an IP address (e.g. `203.0.113.5`) or a CIDR range (e.g. `10.0.0.0/24`) in the IP Blocklist, add an optional note, and click **Add**. Blocked IPs are rejected on WordPress's `init` hook before any output is sent.

### How do I verify my WordPress core files haven't been tampered with?
Go to **Security → Integrity** tab and click **Run Integrity Check**. WP Manager Pro fetches the official MD5 checksums from wordpress.org and compares every file in `wp-admin/` and `wp-includes/`. Any modified or missing files are listed with their actual hash, expected hash, and last-modified date.

### How do I enable Two-Factor Authentication?
Go to **Security → Two-Factor** tab and click **Set Up Two-Factor Auth**. Scan the QR code with Google Authenticator, Authy, or any TOTP app, then enter the 6-digit code to verify and activate. Eight one-time backup codes are generated and shown once — save them somewhere safe. To disable 2FA, click **Disable 2FA** on the same tab.

### How do I enable WebP or AVIF image uploads?
Go to **Image Tools** and toggle **WebP Conversion** or **AVIF Support** on. WebP requires GD or ImageMagick. AVIF requires PHP 8.1+ with GD (`imageavif` function) or ImageMagick compiled with the AVIF codec. The support status cards at the top of the page show what your server supports.

### How do I use Login As (admin impersonation)?
Go to **Users**, find the user you want to impersonate, and click the person/arrow icon. WP Manager Pro generates a secure single-use token (valid for 5 minutes) and redirects you to WP Admin logged in as that user. Only existing admins can trigger this — the token is validated server-side and deleted on first use.

### Is it safe to edit files with the File Manager?
Yes — all file paths are validated against `ABSPATH` using `realpath()` to prevent path traversal. `wp-config.php`, `.htaccess`, and `index.php` are write-protected from deletion and rename. The editor is limited to text-based file types and a 2 MB read limit. That said, treat it like any code editor: incorrect edits can break your site.

### Can I run custom SQL queries in the Database Manager?
The **SQL Runner** tab is read-only — it accepts `SELECT`, `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, and `EXPLAIN` statements only. Write operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, etc.) are blocked at the API level. For write operations, use the **Table Data** tab to insert, edit, or delete individual rows via the UI.

### How do I check for plugin/theme updates without leaving WP Manager Pro?
Click the **Check Updates** button (top-right of Plugin Manager or Theme Manager). This forces WordPress to re-query WordPress.org for fresh update data and immediately refreshes the list — no page reload needed.

### Does WP Manager Pro support WordPress Multisite?
The plugin works on Multisite but is designed for single-site use. It installs and activates on a per-site basis. Network-level management (network activation, super-admin actions) is not currently supported.

### How do I uninstall WP Manager Pro?
Deactivate the plugin from WP Admin → Plugins. On deactivation, the maintenance file (`wp-content/maintenance.php`) is automatically removed. Deactivating does **not** delete your notes or settings stored in `wp_options` — these are cleaned up if you manually delete the plugin afterward.

### Where are notes stored?
Notes are stored in a custom `wp_wmp_notes` database table created on plugin activation. They persist across plugin updates.

### Why does the page look unstyled or show a blank white area?
This can happen if another plugin or theme loads conflicting scripts on the WP Manager Pro page. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors. If you see a Content Security Policy (CSP) violation, your server's CSP headers may be blocking the inline React app. You may need to whitelist the plugin's script.

## Security

- All REST endpoints are protected by `manage_options` capability check
- WordPress nonce validation on every request (`wp_rest`)
- File Manager uses `realpath()` path traversal prevention — all paths must resolve inside `ABSPATH`
- Critical files (`wp-config.php`, `.htaccess`, `index.php`) are write-protected in delete and rename endpoints
- File read is limited to text-based extensions (no binary execution)
- Login-As tokens are single-use, stored in WordPress transients, expire in 5 minutes
- Database query runner is read-only (`SELECT`, `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, `EXPLAIN` only)
- SVG uploads are sanitized server-side: strips `<script>`, `on*` event attrs, `javascript:` hrefs, `<foreignObject>`, `<base>` tags
- Username rename validates with `sanitize_user()` + `validate_username()`, checks for conflicts
- Reset Tools requires explicit `confirm: true` flag; uses WordPress core deletion functions only
- **v1.3.0** Admin URL protection blocks GET requests to `wp-login.php` without the secret key; POST/password-reset flows are unaffected
- **v2.0.0** Login Attempt Limiter uses WordPress transients with IP-keyed lock keys; brute-force protection fires at priority 30 on the `authenticate` filter
- **v2.0.0** IP Blocklist matches exact IPs and CIDR ranges via bitwise mask comparison; enforced on `init` before any page output
- **v2.0.0** TOTP 2FA uses 100% native PHP (no Composer): `random_bytes`, `hash_hmac('sha1')`, custom base32 encoder/decoder; backup codes stored as MD5 hashes
- All user inputs are sanitized with `sanitize_text_field()`, `absint()`, `sanitize_hex_color()`, `wp_kses_post()`
